# RU BOT
The bot was developed for the ru-community, so the bot is translated into ru only.

# Install package

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Config and run bot
Make a variable in the environment called DISCORD_TOKEN with the token in it
There is a second way to specify it via config
```py
python main.py
```
